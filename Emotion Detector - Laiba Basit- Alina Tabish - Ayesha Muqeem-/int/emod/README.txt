PROBLEM STATEMENT:
Most of the intelligent agents these day focus on the obtaining the userâ€™s intention and showing them pertinent data without understanding the emotion

OUR SOLUTION:
Our goal is to not create an intelligent agent but an intelligent agent that understands emotions. This little agent will detect the emotion that the user is feeling at the moment and it will converse with the user accordingly.
